Long Project for Machine Learning at the University of Oklahoma <br>
 <br>
Goal is to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset as well as a dataset of images we collected in a variety of methods to gain exposure to different Machine Learning techniques and to find which one works better. <br>
If one of the methods works extremely well, the hope is to use it for the Sooner Rover team which competes in the University Mars Rover challenge. <br>
 <br>
The CIFAR-10 images were gathered from the following source:
[Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/learning-features-2009-TR.pdf), Alex Krizhevsky, 2009.
